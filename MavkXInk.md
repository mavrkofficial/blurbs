## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Integration Points**

### **Inky App Integration**
```typescript
// Inky app enhancement
interface InkyApp {
  // Existing trading functionality
  tradeTokens(): void;
  
  // New Mavrk integration
  createToken(): void;        // Launch Mavrk token creation
  manageToken(): void;        // Token management interface
  collectFees(): void;        // Fee collection dashboard
}
```

- **Revenue Optimization**: Maximize fee collection and treasury management
- **Ecosystem Growth**: Drive $INK adoption and Ink chain development

## üéØ **Implementation Timeline**

### **Phase 1: Integration (3-6 months)**
- Inky app "Create Token" feature development
- $INK native pairing implementation
- Multi-chain deployment optimization

### **Phase 2: Expansion (6-12 months)**
- Additional EVM chain support
- Advanced fee collection dashboard
- Treasury management tools

### **Phase 3: Optimization (12+ months)**
